# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


## Purpose
The purpose of the assignment is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program in effort to prepare for the "silver tsunami".

## Results There is a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables.
- The unique_titles table shows that most of the senior staff is about to retire.
- The Retirement_titles table and before removing duplicates showed that it takes about 10 years for an employee to become senior staff.
- Retiring_titles table shows two managers are of retirement age indicating that older employees are not encouraged towards management.
- The majority of the employees eligible for the mentorship program are going to be retiring as indicated by the mentorship_eligibility.csv

## The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight

In summary Pewlett-Hackard should take time and find out how many employees are senior staff eligible. They should also take into account how long the training would take in order to prepare for the silver-tusnami. Unfortunately there are not enough retirement eligible eligible employees available to train the remaining employees. 

Pewlett-Hackard will need to hire and onboard thousands of employees as there is 19k employees left that are not retiring.
