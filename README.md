# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, while also identifying employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program in effort to prepare for the "silver tsunami".

### Results There is a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables.

- The unique_titles table shows that most of the senior staff is about to retire.

- The Retirement_titles table before removing duplicates showed that it takes about 10 years for an employee to become senior staff.

- Retiring_titles table shows two managers are of retirement age indicating that older employees are not encouraged towards management.

- The majority of the employees eligible for the mentorship program are also going to be retiring as indicated by the mentorship_eligibility.csv

## Summary 

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

In summary it appears there will be as many as 70k employees retiring. Pewlett-Hackard should take time and find out how many lower level employees are senior staff eligible. They should also take into account how long the training would take in order to prepare for the silver-tusnami. Unfortunately there are not enough retirement eligible employees available to train the remaining employees.
